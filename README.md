# Apigee Remote Service CLI

This is the CLI for Apigee's Remote Service for Envoy. The CLI installs the "remote-service"
proxy into Apigee Runtime and provides certain runtime management functions on the command line.

## Getting Started

There is specific documentation for your Apigee platform:

* [Apigee Edge on Google Cloud or Hybrid](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/envoy-adapter/latest/concepts)
* [Classic Apigee Edge](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/envoy-adapter)

## Support

Issues filed on Github are not subject to service level agreements (SLAs) and responses should be
assumed to be on an ad-hoc volunteer basis. The [Apigee community board](https://community.apigee.com/)
is recommended as for community support and is regularly checked by Apigee experts.

Apigee customers should use [formal support channels](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/support).
